Around 400 years ago, in the wake of the Order of the Twilight Sentinels' valiant efforts, the nations of the world came together to establish the Eternal Vigil, a coalition of warriors and mages tasked with maintaining a constant watch over The Breach and preventing its dark energies from spreading further. The Vigil erected mighty fortresses and wards around the perimeter of The Breach, stationing elite soldiers and powerful sorcerers to stand guard against any incursions from the otherworldly realm. Since then, the Vigil has remained steadfast in its duty, standing as a bulwark against the encroaching darkness and ensuring that The Breach remains contained, if not fully sealed.
