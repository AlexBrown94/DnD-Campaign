# [[Cedric Wormwood]]

Cedric Wormwood is a thin, gangly, and distasteful man who serves as the Minister of Propaganda on the Council of Advisors. With his oily hair and perpetual sneer, Cedric is the mastermind behind the city's propaganda machine, responsible for shaping public perception and maintaining the illusion of the Baron's benevolent rule. He excels at spreading misinformation, demonizing dissenters, and glorifying the achievements of the ruling regime. Despite his repulsive appearance and unpleasant demeanor, Cedric's cunning and manipulation make him a valuable asset to Baron Von Drak's inner circle.

Cedric Wormwood is a gaunt and wiry man, with pale, sallow skin stretched tightly over angular features. His eyes, small and beady, dart around incessantly, taking in every detail with a calculating intensity. His greasy hair hangs limply around his face, framing a thin-lipped mouth that is perpetually curled into a sneer of disdain. He dresses in drab, ill-fitting garments that hang loosely from his frame, giving him the appearance of a carrion bird scavenging for scraps. Despite his unassuming appearance, there is a palpable aura of malice that surrounds him, like a shadow lurking in the darkness.
