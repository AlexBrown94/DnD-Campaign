# [[Lord Reynard Blackwood]]

Lord Reynard Blackwood is a shrewd and calculating nobleman who serves as the Master of Coin on the Council of Advisors. Despite his aristocratic background, Lord Blackwood is known for his pragmatism and willingness to do whatever it takes to maintain his wealth and influence in the city. He is skilled at manipulating the city's finances to ensure that the Baron's coffers remain full, even at the expense of the common citizens. While he may outwardly appear refined and sophisticated, Lord Blackwood's true motivations are driven by a desire for power and wealth.

Lord Reynard Blackwood is a tall and imposing figure, with sharp features and piercing blue eyes that seem to size up everyone he encounters. He carries himself with an air of confidence and sophistication, dressed in fine, tailored garments adorned with subtle symbols of his noble lineage. His hair, a sleek mane of dark chestnut, is always impeccably styled, and his movements are precise and deliberate. Despite his outward charm, there is a calculating glint in his eyes that betrays his ruthless ambition.
