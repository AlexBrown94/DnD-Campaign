## Info
Each major city has a Thieves Guild operating within it. Some Guilds operate from hidden bunkers and some, the more prestigious and accepted, even operate as open organizations.

The Thieves Guild usually takes on contracts from a wide variety of contacts. These range from simple merchants to businesses to other guilds to even royalty and government officials.
They typically employ thieves, mercenaries, pickpockets and spies. If you have deft hands and a perchance for thievery you can find reliable work with The Thieves Guild, provided you have a way of contacting them of course.

Each Guild has a Hall Master who oversees the Guild's operations within the city, and represents the Guild in meetings in the overall Guild.

One Guild master oversees the entire Guild's operations across all provinces and dictates the overall course for The Thieves Guild.
